      text="Dear fungiSMASH users. On 2019-03-29 our old fungiSMASH site died. 
        In order to restore the service, we have moved the website to the same 
        servers running bacterial antiSMASH. To keep the load manageable until 
        we can buy some new servers, we have disabled CPU intensive analyses 
        like CASSIS for the time being.
        We apologise for the inconvenience, the antiSMASH team."
